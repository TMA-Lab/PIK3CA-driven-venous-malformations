Venous malformations (VMs) are vascular anomalies frequently caused by somatic PIK3CA mutations, which aberrantly activate the PI3Ka-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Despite the repurposing of PI3K pathway inhibitors for treatment, curative therapies are still lacking. Here, we identify a venous-restricted signaling circuit in which derailed PI3Ka activity amplifies TIE2 signaling through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Using a mouse model of Pik3caH1047R-driven VM, we show that cutaneous vascular lesions develop independently of developmental vascular growth or VEGF signaling. Single-cell transcriptomics and clonal tracking in vivo revealed a post-capillary venous phenotype in mutant endothelial cells (ECs), characterized by selective clonal expansion and linked to suppression of the AKT-inhibited transcription factor FOXO1 and its target genes, including the TIE2 antagonist ANGPT2. An imbalance in TIE2 ligands, further exacerbated by the aberrant recruitment of venous smooth muscle cells (SMCs) producing the TIE2 agonist ANGPT1, led to increased TIE2 activity in both mouse and human VMs. Pharmacological TIE2 inhibition or ANGPT neutralization, combined with mTOR blockade, significantly suppressed growth of advanced VM lesions. These findings uncover a PI3K-FOXO1-ANGPT-TIE2 circuit as a critical driver of PIK3CA-related VM and highlight TIE2 signaling as a promising access point for therapeutic intervention.
